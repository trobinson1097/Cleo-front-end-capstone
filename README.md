# Cleo

“Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self.” ― The Bhagavad Gita

## Description

Cleo is a yoga application that allows users to catalog pose cards with brief descriptions, recommendations, and pictures of different yoga poses in their collection. Teachers create cards for users who are looking to learn more about poses and access resources pertaining to yoga. 
The inspiration for the name of this application is my dog, Cleo. She is a very bendy girl who I love dearly. 

Why a yoga app?

As a Yoga Teacher in training, I feel blessed for all of the benefits I have received on and off of the mat. I wish that this highly effective and beneficial practice was more accessible to communities that are underrepresented and underserved, communities I believe could benefit the most from yoga. I made Cleo scalable so that this dream of mine can come true, with resources and ease of access, I hope you enjoy my super simple and straightforward take on a resource application.
